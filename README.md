✈️ Airline Flight Data Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data using SQL and Power BI to gain insights into flight operations, delays, cancellations, passenger volume, and revenue. SQL is used for data extraction and transformation, while Power BI is used for data modeling and interactive visualization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data extraction, filtering, aggregation

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard creation

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

📂 Data Source

The data is stored in a SQL database containing airline flight details such as:

Flight ID

Airline name

Airport and city

Flight date

Passenger count

Revenue

Delay status

Cancellation reason

🔄 Data Extraction Process (SQL → Power BI)

Connected Power BI directly to the SQL Server database.

Used SQL queries to:

Select required columns

Filter unnecessary records

Aggregate flight, passenger, and revenue data

Loaded cleaned data into Power BI.

Performed additional transformations using Power Query.

Built relationships and measures using DAX.
